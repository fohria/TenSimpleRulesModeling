    "This one is a bit tricky. We have two models: blind and state-based (which I will sometimes call \"sighted\"). So far so good. What can be confusing (at least it was to me) is the difference in what is being plotted in Figure A, B and C. So based on the plots from the paper, here's what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure A:** We simulate the behaviour of both models and plot their performance. The two lines represent two different models, each with its own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure B:** This shows how we model the two participants with the state-based (sighted) model. In other words, we fit the sighted model to both blind and sighted data. One model, two sets of data. Interestingly, it seems the sighted model has a higher likelihood for explaining the blind data than the sighted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure C:** If we use the fitted parameters found in figure B and *simulate* using the sighted model, we find that the behaviour produced (in the form of learning curves) looks like the sighted behaviour in figure A. But when simulating the sighted model with the parameters fit to *blind data* it produces behaviour that doesn't look like the behaviour in figure A.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, it may be *theoretically* correct that one model has higher likelihood than the true one (figure b), we should always test this in *practice* to confirm if the behaviour is the same (figure c vs figure a).\n",

    "Imagine there are three different pictures that can be shown to you, and you have to learn which of three buttons to push depending on the picture. That's the \"sighted\" model. For the \"blind\" model, imagine that you are, well, blind. You get told when it's time to push a button, maybe you will learn the correct pattern, maybe you won't. Sounds like a horrifying task now that I put it that way.\n",
