# TenSimpleRulesModeling

This repo contains a Python version of the [original Matlab code](https://github.com/AnneCollins/TenSimpleRulesModeling) for the paper "Ten Simple Rules for Computational Modeling of Psychological Data".

The files are named according to what box in the paper they describe.

I made an effort to make the code easy to understand, so in most cases I've changed variable names into more verbose ones. There *should* be comments indicating their equivalent name in the paper. I took this opportunity to practice collating data into the ["tidy" format](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper), so those parts may not be as neat as they could be.

I've also added comments and clarifications here and there, and some additional analyses where appropriate, as well as confused discussions.

## Original Readme
This is the code for the figures in the "Ten Simple Rules for Computational Modeling of Psychological Data" paper.
